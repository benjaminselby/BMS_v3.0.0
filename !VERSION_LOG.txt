1.5
=============================================================================================================

- [selby_b 2020.08.21] No modifications made. Just built project in VS2019 and deployed. Previous version 
	on client machines appeared to be v1.2. 
	

=============================================================================================================
2.0.0
=============================================================================================================

- Significant revision of user interface and code base. Window layout modified to horizontal in order 
	to better accommodate laptop screen (previous version was too long and disappeared off bottom of screen).

- Added MatchingComboBox control, which is a new object type that inherits from the .NET ComboBox control. 
	This improves on the standard ComboBox because typed text will match at any position in the string 
	list that the ComboBox contains, not just the beginning of strings. 

- Originally planned to disable the ability to impersonate another staff member via selection box, 
	but this has been retained because it is apparently useful for admin staff to be able to add sanctions
	on behalf of a teacher. However, in order to avoid confusion regarding who has actually set detentions, 
	I added a 'ModifiedBy' field to the [dbo.uStudentSanctions] table in Synergy to record the true ID of the 
	current user entering the sanction, even if they have set the sanction on behalf of another staff member. 


=============================================================================================================
2.0.1
=============================================================================================================

- Icon was not appearing on desktop. Fixed installer. 

- Fixed bug where using an apostrophe in the 'Comment' field was causing a syntax error for the SQL code
	which inserts a new record into the system, e.g. "Didn't attend soccer practice." would cause an error. 


=============================================================================================================
2.0.2
=============================================================================================================

- Most SQL queries moved to stored procedures. Any which were not moved to stored procedures were moved 
	to the APP.CONFIG file. 

- Moved default config values from code into APP.CONFIG file and modified ConfigHandler to load from 
	there instead. 


=============================================================================================================
2.0.3
=============================================================================================================

- Moved logic for choosing available sanction days (based on type) to a stored procedure in the Synergy 
	database. So, if detention days change, we won't have to re-deploy the application. 

- Added an event handler for the sanction date picker combobox so that dates with existing bookings 
	cannot be selected, and a warning message is displayed. 

NOTIFICATION EMAILS:

	These are planned for rollout for SENIOR SCHOOL ONLY prior to end of Term 2 2021 if possible.  

	Originally, the intention was for BMS to send these emails, but after discussing this with Adrian, 
	we think that it would be best to have a delay on the sending of communications to parents so that
	teachers have a chance to modify detentions etc. in case they make a mistake. The entire mail process
	will probably need to be moved to a script which runs once per day in the evening or something. 

		- Mail to: Teacher setting the detention, TG teacher, Head of Year, 
			student, and student's contacts. 

		TESTERS: 
			- Tracey Warren (13028) son in Y10: Jaylen Warren (21590). Accepted. 
			- Scott Bayne (32027) son in Y11: Ethan Bayne (32029).
			- Rachel Empson (31927) son in Y12: Louis Gratwick (31928).

Deployed. [selby_b 2021.05.10]

v2.0.4
=============================================================================================================

- Put version number in title bar of the application and nowhere else. We don't want it in the path to the 
	executable so that apps such as BMS Admin can always find the app in the same path location. 

- Modified install path so it is the same regardless of BMS version. This is important so that BMS Admin 
	knows where to find the BMS program so it can run it. Make sure that the install location is stored 
	in the WOODCROFT.UBMSCONFIG table in Synergy so that the BMS Admin table can launch it. 

	Currently set to: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Woodcroft College\BMS\BMS.exe'.

- Put in some better error handling (Try/Catch) to report exception messages when they occur. Currently, 
	the app fails silently which means there's no way of knowing what's going wrong. 

- For all Junior School students, changed the interface label 'Sanction Date' to 'Incident Date'. 
	Also for JS students the dates in the Incident Date ComboBox now run from the present day 
	up to 2 weeks in the past. This is because JS use the Sanction Date to record WHEN the 
	incident occurred, not when the actual 	punishment should be applied. 
	(Request from Craig Bennett - 09.08.2021).

=============================================================================================================
v2.0.5
=============================================================================================================

- Implemented a button and window which enables staff to view, modify and delete their existing sanctions. 
	This is useful because when staff currently want to change an existing sanction, they need to contact 
	Nicki or Alison in the Student Services office to do it for them. 

- Modifications to ConfigHandler to make it simpler. 

- Moved some interface settings to the config table. 

- Added a new column to the back end data table [dbo.uStudentSanctions] called [InformationOnly]. To be 
	used to record when a sanction is going to be handled by a staff member themselves, and the student
	should not be expected in a scheduled detention session which would be run by a HoY. 

	This breaks with the previous data model, which recorded such sanctions as 'completed', but I don't 
	think it's good to continue with that as it's not correct information: the student has not 'completed'
	the sanction yet. There may be some backward/sideways compatibility issues with this as we try to 
	integrate it with other existing systems.

=============================================================================================================
v3.0.0
=============================================================================================================

SIGNIFICANT CHANGE: The BMS and BMS Admin applications are now combined into a single deployment of 
	BMS. The app can be deployed to all staff, and on startup the application should determine which 
	level of functionality a user should have access to. 

	This represents the first stage in our attempt to consolidate as much application and data access
	architecture as possible into a single application.
